# ERS
Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. 
All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. 
Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance 
managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement as well as submit their own requests. 
However, only a different finance manager may approve said request.
